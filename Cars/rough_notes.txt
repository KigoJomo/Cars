#changes made:

1.modified admin.py and models.py to make the admin interface more intuitive and avoid confusion when viewing and interacting with data objects.

2. modified views.py (search view) -- the search function now works as expected

3. (cars.html) -- enclosed the for loop that renders images in an imageContainer

4. included the imageContainer mentioned above in style.css

5. added more CarImages (for Audi Qs7 and Subaru Impreza) via the admin interface
    -- make a point to add more images for other cars too --
